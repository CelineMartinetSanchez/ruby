# Solution to questions

# 1 - Temperature
	{temperature: "10 deg Celsius", pressure: "10 bar"}
	# I chose that because we can need to change the temperature and the pressure another time.
	# Symbols can't change.
	#It will also be easier to access the data with Symbols. 

# 2 - Names
	user_name = :bob 
	# This lets us access Bob's personnal account easily.

# 3 - Actions
	{action: "show", controller = :users}
	# We can do different actions (show, hide, ...) but the controller is always the user.
	#So we could have access to the user very quickly.
